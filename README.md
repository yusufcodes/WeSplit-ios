# WeSplit-ios

Basic app to help me understand some basics of Swift and SwiftUI. Concepts learned:
- Closures
- Basic State Management using ```@State``` and ```@FocusState```
- Computed Values
- Two Way Binding with state values
- Use of the ```Locale``` module to grab user locale information, such as currency
- Using SwiftUI's ```ForEach(...)``` to construct views
